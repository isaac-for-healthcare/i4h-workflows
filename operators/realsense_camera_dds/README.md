## Overview

This operator provides a Holoscan interface to Intel RealSense cameras, enabling real-time capture and streaming of RGB and depth data through DDS (Data Distribution Service). It supports configurable resolution, framerate, and device selection, making it suitable for robotics and computer vision applications. The operator can optionally display captured frames using Holoviz for visualization and debugging purposes.
