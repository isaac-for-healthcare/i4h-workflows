## Overview

This repository contains **healthcare robotics workflows** - complete, end-to-end implementations that demonstrate how to build, simulate, and deploy robotic systems for specific medical applications using the [Nvidia Isaac for Healthcare](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare) platform.

### What are Workflows?

![Key features](./docs/source/key_features.jpg)

Workflows are comprehensive reference implementations that showcase the complete development pipeline from simulation to real-world deployment. Each workflow includes digital twin environments, AI model training capabilities, and deployment frameworks for specific healthcare robotics applications.

### Available Workflows
This repository currently includes three main workflows:

- **[Robotic Surgery](./workflows/robotic_surgery/README.md)** - Physics-based surgical robot simulation framework with photorealistic rendering for developing autonomous surgical skills. Supports da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), dual-arm configurations, and STAR surgical arms. This workflow enables researchers and medical device companies to train AI models for surgical assistance, validate robot behaviors safely, and accelerate development through GPU-parallelized reinforcement learning. Includes pre-built surgical subtasks like suture needle manipulation and precise reaching tasks.
- **[Robotic Ultrasound](./workflows/robotic_ultrasound/README.md)** - Comprehensive autonomous ultrasound imaging system featuring physics-accurate sensor simulation through GPU-accelerated raytracing technology that models ultrasound wave propagation, tissue interactions, and acoustic properties in real-time. The raytracing ultrasound simulator generates photorealistic B-mode images by simulating acoustic wave physics, enabling synthetic data generation for training AI models without requiring physical ultrasound hardware. Supports multiple AI policies (PI0, GR00T N1), distributed communication via RTI DDS, and Holoscan deployment for clinical applications. This workflow enables medical imaging researchers, ultrasound device manufacturers, and healthcare AI developers to train robotic scanning protocols, validate autonomous imaging algorithms, and accelerate development through GPU-accelerated simulation before clinical deployment.
- **[Telesurgery](./workflows/telesurgery/README.md)** - Real-time remote surgical operations framework supporting both simulated and physical environments with low-latency video streaming, haptic feedback, and distributed control systems. This workflow features H.264/HEVC hardware-accelerated video encoding, RTI DDS communication, cross-platform deployment (x86/AARCH64), and seamless sim-to-real transition. Designed for surgical robotics companies, medical device manufacturers, and telemedicine providers to develop remote surgical capabilities, validate teleoperation systems, and deploy scalable telesurgery solutions across different network conditions.

Each workflow provides complete simulation environments, training datasets, pre-trained models, and deployment tools to accelerate your healthcare robotics development.
