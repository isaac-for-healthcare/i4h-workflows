**Isaac for Healthcare** is a domain-specific framework built on top of Nvidia Isaac Sim/Lab and Nvidia Omniverse, enabling developers to design, simulate, test, and train AI-based robots and autonomous systems, and generate synthetic data across:
- **Therapeutics** (e.g., surgical robotics, interventional radiology and radiotherapy)
- **Diagnostics** (e.g., ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), cone-beam CT (CBCT))
- **Hospital & patient care** (e.g., hospitals, operating rooms and intensive care units with medication delivery, supply transport, disinfection robots, cobots)
- **Rehabilitation & assistive technologies** (e.g., physical therapy robots, exoskeletons, etc.)

Isaac for Healthcare will extend and tailor Isaac Sim/Lab and Omniverse to enable multi-scale simulation (in a highly realistic virtual environment) â€” from anatomy to sensors, surgical instruments, robotic systems, operating rooms, intensive care units, labs, sterile processing departments (SPD), and full hospital environments.

Isaac for Healthcare enables healthcare technology developers to leverage **NVIDIA technologies** to:
- Accelerate development and testing of AI algorithms with synthetic data generated in digital twin.
- Accelerate development, training and testing of robotic policies in digital twin environments.
- Enable development, training and testing of systems with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL).
- Seamlessly transition from simulation to physical systems (Sim2Real).

## Key Features

![Key features](./docs/source/key_features.jpg)

**Isaac for Healthcare Workflows** will bring the combined power of digital twins and physical AI for:
- **Digital prototyping** of next-gen healthcare robotic systems, sensors and instruments.
- **Training AI models** with synthetic data generation (SDG) augmented with real data.
- **Evaluating AI models** in digital twin environment with HIL.
- **Collecting data for training robotic policies** through imitation learning, by enabling XR and/or haptics enabled teleoperation of robotic systems in digital twin.
- **Training robotic policies** for augmented dexterity (e.g., in robot-assisted surgery). Leveraging GPU parallelization to train reinforcement and imitation learning algorithms.
- **Continuous testing (CT) of robotic systems** through HIL digital twin systems.
- **Creating interactive training** experience for clinicians/users (pre-op planning, post-op evaluations/insights).
