**Isaac-for-Healthcare** is a domain-specific framework built on top of Nvidia Isaac Sim and Nvidia Omniverse, enabling developers to design, simulate, test, and train AI-based robots and autonomous systems, and generate synthetic data across:
- **Therapeutics** (e.g., surgical robotics, interventional radiology and radiotherapy)
- **Diagnostics** (e.g., ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), cone-beam CT)
- **Hospital & patient care** (e.g., hospitals, operating rooms and intensive care units with medication delivery, supply transport, disinfection robots, cobots)
- **Rehabilitation & assistive technologies** (e.g., physical therapy robots, exoskeletons, etc.)

Isaac-for-Healthcare will extend and tailor Isaac Sim/Lab and Omniverse to enable multi-scale simulation (in a highly realistic virtual environment) â€” from anatomy to sensors, surgical instruments, robotic systems, operating rooms, intensive care units, labs, SPD, and full hospital environments.

Isaac-for-Healthcare enables healthcare technology developers to leverage **NVIDIA technologies** to:
- Accelerate development and testing of AI algorithms with synthetic data generated in digital twin.
- Accelerate development, training and testing of robotic policies in digital twin environments.
- Enable development, training and testing of systems with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL).
- Seamlessly transition from simulation to physical systems (Sim2Real).

## Key Features

![Key features](./docs/source/key_features.jpg)

**Isaac-for-Healthcare Workflows** will bring the combined power of digital twins and physical AI for:
- **Digital prototyping** of next-gen healthcare robotic systems, sensors and instruments.
- **Training AI models** with synthetic data generation (SDG) augmented with real data.
- **Evaluating AI models** in digital twin environment with HIL.
- **Collecting data for training robotic policies** through imitation learning, by enabling XR and/or haptics enabled teleoperation of robotic systems in digital twin.
- **Training robotic policies** for augmented dexterity (e.g., in robot-assisted surgery). Leveraging GPU parallelization to train reinforcement and imitation learning algorithms.
- **Continuous testing (CT) of robotic systems** through HIL digital twin systems.
- **Creating interactive training** experience for clinicians/users (pre-op planning, post-op evaluations/insights).
