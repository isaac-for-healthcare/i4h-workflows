# Robotic Ultrasound Workflow

![Robotic Ultrasound Workflow](../../docs/source/robotic_us_workflow.jpg)

The Robotic Ultrasound Workflow is a comprehensive solution designed for healthcare professionals, medical imaging researchers, and ultrasound device manufacturers working in the field of autonomous ultrasound imaging. This workflow provides a robust framework for simulating, training, and deploying robotic ultrasound systems using NVIDIA's advanced ray tracing technology. By offering a physics-accurate ultrasound simulation environment, it enables researchers to develop and validate autonomous scanning protocols, train AI models for image interpretation, and accelerate the development of next-generation ultrasound systems without requiring physical hardware.

The workflow features a state-of-the-art ultrasound sensor simulation that leverages GPU-accelerated ray tracing to model the complex physics of ultrasound wave propagation. The simulator accurately represents:
- Acoustic wave propagation through different tissue types
- Tissue-specific acoustic properties (impedance, attenuation, scattering)
- Real-time B-mode image generation based on echo signals
- Dynamic tissue deformation and movement
- Multi-frequency transducer capabilities

This physics-based approach enables the generation of highly realistic synthetic ultrasound images that closely match real-world data, making it ideal for training AI models and validating autonomous scanning algorithms. The workflow supports multiple AI policies (PI0, GR00T N1) and can be deployed using NVIDIA Holoscan for clinical applications, providing a complete pipeline from simulation to real-world deployment.

‚úÖ **Setup complete!** Your robotic ultrasound workflow is now ready to use.

## Running Workflows
(requested by VDR)

### First Runs

Now that you've completed the setup, you can try the following workflows:

#### Policy-Based Control with PI0
```bash
(python -m policy_runner.run_policy --policy pi0 & python -m simulation.environments.sim_with_dds --enable_cameras & wait)
```

What's expected (requested by VDR):
- Isaac Sim window running with a Franka robot arm driven by the pi0 policy
- Policy runner is reading images from the cameras and sending commands to the robot arm to move to the target position on DDS topics

> **Note:**
> You may see `"IsaacSim 4.5.0 is not responding"`.
> It can take several minutes to download the assets and models from the internet and load them to the scene.
> If this is the first time you run the workflow, it can take up to **10 minutes**.
> If your network isn't in the US region, it can take longer to download the assets.
> To exit the workflow, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal and run `bash workflows/robotic_ultrasound/reset.sh` to kill all processes spawned by the workflow.

#### Policy + Ultrasound Simulation
```bash
(python -m policy_runner.run_policy --policy pi0 & \
python -m simulation.environments.sim_with_dds --enable_cameras &  \
python -m simulation.examples.ultrasound_raytracing & \
python -m utils.visualization & \
wait)
```

What's expected (requested by VDR):
- Isaac Sim window running with a Franka robot arm driven by the pi0 policy
- Policy runner is reading images from the cameras and sending commands to the robot arm to move to the target position on DDS topics
- Ultrasound raytracing simulator is running and streaming ultrasound images on DDS topics
- Python GUI Visualization is running and displaying the wrist/room camera images and ultrasound images

> **Note:**
> The ultrasound image would stay still until the isaacsim simulation finishes loading the assets.
> To exit the workflow, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal and run `bash workflows/robotic_ultrasound/reset.sh` to kill all processes spawned by the workflow.

#### Interactive Teleoperation
Control the robotic arm directly using keyboard, SpaceMouse, or gamepad:
```bash
(python -m simulation.examples.ultrasound_raytracing & \
python -m simulation.environments.teleoperation.teleop_se3_agent --enable_cameras & \
python workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts/utils/visualization.py & \
wait)
```

What's expected (requested by VDR):
- Isaac Sim window with the assets loaded
- You can control the robot arm directly using keyboard (pressing buttons like 'w', 'a', 's', 'd'). Check [Teleoperation](./scripts/simulation/environments/teleoperation/README.md) for more details.
- Ultrasound raytracing simulator is running and streaming ultrasound images on DDS topics
- Python GUI Visualization is running and displaying the wrist/room camera images and ultrasound images

> **Notes:**
> To exit the workflow, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal and run `bash workflows/robotic_ultrasound/reset.sh` to kill all processes spawned by the workflow.

- [Raytracing Ultrasound Simulator](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-sensor-simulation/tree/main/ultrasound-raytracing)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Install NVIDIA Driver
Install or upgrade to the latest NVIDIA driver from [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/)

**Note**: The Raytracing Ultrasound Simulator requires driver version >= 555.

#### 2. Install CUDA
Install CUDA from [NVIDIA CUDA Quick Start Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/index.html)

**Note**: The Raytracing Ultrasound Simulator requires CUDA version >= 12.6.

#### 3. Obtain RTI DDS License
RTI DDS is the common communication package for all scripts. Please refer to [DDS website](https://www.rti.com/products) for registration. You will need to obtain a license file and set the `RTI_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable to its path.

#### 4. Install Dependencies

##### Install Miniconda
You can visit [Installing Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions) website to install miniconda.

1. Download Miniconda installer
```bash
# Download Miniconda installer
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# Run the installer
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

##### Create Conda Environment
```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n robotic_ultrasound python=3.10 -y
# Activate the environment
conda activate robotic_ultrasound
```

##### Install Raytracing Ultrasound Simulator
Choose one of the following options:
- **(Use pre-built binary)** Download the pre-release version from [here](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-sensor-simulation/releases/tag/v0.2.0rc2) and extract to `workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts/raysim`
- **(Compiling from source)** Install and build following instructions in [Raytracing Ultrasound Simulator](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-sensor-simulation/tree/main/ultrasound-raytracing#installation)

##### Install All Dependencies
The main script `tools/env_setup_robot_us.sh` installs all necessary dependencies. It first installs common base components and then policy-specific packages based on an argument.

###### Base Components
- IsaacSim 4.5.0 (and core dependencies)
- IsaacLab 2.1.0
- Robotic Ultrasound Extension (`robotic_us_ext`)
- Lerobot (from Hugging Face)
- Holoscan 2.9.0 (including associated Holoscan apps)
- Essential build tools and libraries

###### Policy-Specific Dependencies
The script supports installing additional policy-specific dependencies using the `--policy` flag:
- **`--policy pi0` (Default)**: Installs PI0 policy dependencies (e.g., OpenPI)
- **`--policy gr00tn1`**: Installs GR00T N1 policy dependencies (e.g., Isaac-GR00T)
- **`--policy none`**: Installs only common base dependencies

Run the script from the repository root:
```bash
cd <path-to-i4h-workflows>
bash tools/env_setup_robot_us.sh --policy <your_chosen_policy>
```

**Note**: During dependency installation, you may see PyTorch version mismatch warnings. These are expected and can be safely ignored:
```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
isaaclab 0.34.9 requires torch==2.5.1, but you have torch 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
isaaclab-rl 0.1.0 requires torch==2.5.1, but you have torch 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
isaaclab-tasks 0.10.24 requires torch==2.5.1, but you have torch 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
rl-games 1.6.1 requires wandb<0.13.0,>=0.12.11, but you have wandb 0.19.9 which is incompatible.
```
These warnings occur because `isaaclab` and `openpi` require different fixed versions of PyTorch. The workflow will function correctly despite these warnings.

### Asset Setup

Download the required assets using:
```bash
i4h-asset-retrieve
```

The total size of the assets is about 65GB, but individual assets will be downloaded when you run a specific workflow automatically. (requested by VDR)

This will download assets to `~/.cache/i4h-assets/<sha256>`. For more details, refer to the [Asset Container Helper](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-asset-catalog/blob/v0.2.0rc1/docs/catalog_helper.md).

**Note**: During asset download, you may see warnings about blocking functions. This is expected behavior and the download will complete successfully despite these warnings.

### Environment Variables

Before running any scripts, you need to set up the following environment variables:

1. **PYTHONPATH**: Set this to point to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-i4h-workflows>/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts:<path-to-i4h-workflows>
   ```
   This ensures Python can find the modules under the [`scripts`](./scripts) directory.

2. **RTI_LICENSE_FILE**: Set this to point to your RTI DDS license file:
   ```bash
   export RTI_LICENSE_FILE=<path-to-rti-license-file>
   ```
   This is required for the DDS communication package to function properly.
</details>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PyTorch Version Warnings**
```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages...
```
These warnings are expected and can be safely ignored. The workflow functions correctly despite version conflicts.

**Asset Download Warnings**
Warnings about blocking functions during asset download are normal and the download will complete successfully.

**GPU Compatibility**
Ensure your GPU has RT Cores. A100 and H100 GPUs are not supported due to lack of RT Cores.

**Environment Variables**
If you encounter import errors, verify that your `PYTHONPATH` includes both the scripts directory and the repository root.

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered above:
1. Check the documentation for each component
2. Review the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows/issues)
3. Open a new issue with detailed error information
