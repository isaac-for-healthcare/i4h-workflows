## üî¨ Technical Overview

The Robotic Ultrasound Workflow is a comprehensive solution designed for healthcare professionals, medical imaging researchers, and ultrasound device manufacturers working in the field of autonomous ultrasound imaging. This workflow provides a robust framework for simulating, training, and deploying robotic ultrasound systems using NVIDIA's advanced ray tracing technology. By offering a physics-accurate ultrasound simulation environment, it enables researchers to develop and validate autonomous scanning protocols, train AI models for image interpretation, and accelerate the development of next-generation ultrasound systems without requiring physical hardware.

The workflow features a state-of-the-art ultrasound sensor simulation that leverages GPU-accelerated ray tracing to model the complex physics of ultrasound wave propagation. The simulator accurately represents:
- Acoustic wave propagation through different tissue types
- Tissue-specific acoustic properties (impedance, attenuation, scattering)
- Real-time B-mode image generation based on echo signals
- Dynamic tissue deformation and movement
- Multi-frequency transducer capabilities

This physics-based approach enables the generation of highly realistic synthetic ultrasound images that closely match real-world data, making it ideal for training AI models and validating autonomous scanning algorithms. The workflow supports multiple AI policies (PI0, GR00T N1) and can be deployed using NVIDIA Holoscan for clinical applications, providing a complete pipeline from simulation to real-world deployment.

- [RTI Connext DDS](https://www.rti.com/products)

### üî® Installation Procedures

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ NVIDIA Graphics Driver Installation
Install or upgrade to the latest NVIDIA driver from [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CUDA Toolkit Installation
Install CUDA from [NVIDIA CUDA Quick Start Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/index.html)

```bash
# Download CUDA installer
 wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
 sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-8
 echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.8/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
 echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.8/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
 source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ RTI DDS License Configuration
1. Register at [RTI Website](https://www.rti.com/products)
2. Download license file
3. Configure environment variable:
```bash
export RTI_LICENSE_FILE=/path/to/rti_license.dat
```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Conda Environment Initialization
```bash
# Install Miniconda
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Create isolated environment
conda create -n robotic_ultrasound python=3.10 -y
conda activate robotic_ultrasound
```

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency Resolution & Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows.git
cd i4h-workflows

# Install base dependencies + policy-specific packages
bash tools/env_setup_robot_us.sh --policy pi0     # PI0 policies
# OR
bash tools/env_setup_robot_us.sh --policy gr00tn1 # GR00T N1 foundation models
# OR
bash tools/env_setup_robot_us.sh --policy none    # Base dependencies only
```
The environment for pi0 and gr00tn1 has conflicts with each other. You can only install one of them at a time.

**Dependency Conflict Resolution:**
Expected PyTorch version conflicts between IsaacLab (2.5.1) and OpenPI (2.6.0) are non-critical and can be ignored.

### üì¶ Asset Management

#### Automated Asset Retrieval

Asset retrieval is done automatically when running the workflow.

#### Manual Asset Retrieval
```bash
i4h-asset-retrieve
```

**Asset Storage**: `~/.cache/i4h-assets/<sha256>/`
**Total Size**: ~65GB (incremental download)
**Reference**: [Asset Catalog Documentation](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-asset-catalog/blob/v0.2.0rc1/docs/catalog_helper.md)

### üîß Environment Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Python module resolution
export PYTHONPATH=<i4h-workflows-root>/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts:<i4h-workflows-root>

# DDS communication middleware
export RTI_LICENSE_FILE=<path-to-rti-license>

# Optional: CUDA runtime optimization
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  # Single GPU selection
```

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Integration Issues

#### üîß Dependency Resolution Conflicts
```bash
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages...
isaaclab 0.34.9 requires torch==2.5.1, but you have torch 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
```
**Resolution**: These PyTorch version conflicts are expected and non-blocking. The workflow maintains compatibility across version differences.

#### üîó Module Import Resolution
**Symptoms**: `ModuleNotFoundError` or `Error while finding module specification for 'xxx'` during script execution
**Resolution**: Verify `PYTHONPATH` includes both `scripts/` directory and repository root.
