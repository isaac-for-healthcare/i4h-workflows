## 🔬 Technical Overview

The Robotic Ultrasound Workflow is a comprehensive solution designed for healthcare professionals, medical imaging researchers, and ultrasound device manufacturers working in the field of autonomous ultrasound imaging. This workflow provides a robust framework for simulating, training, and deploying robotic ultrasound systems using NVIDIA's advanced ray tracing technology. By offering a physics-accurate ultrasound simulation environment, it enables researchers to develop and validate autonomous scanning protocols, train AI models for image interpretation, and accelerate the development of next-generation ultrasound systems without requiring physical hardware.

The workflow features a state-of-the-art ultrasound sensor simulation that leverages GPU-accelerated ray tracing to model the complex physics of ultrasound wave propagation. The simulator accurately represents:
- Acoustic wave propagation through different tissue types
- Tissue-specific acoustic properties (impedance, attenuation, scattering)
- Real-time B-mode image generation based on echo signals
- Dynamic tissue deformation and movement
- Multi-frequency transducer capabilities

This physics-based approach enables the generation of highly realistic synthetic ultrasound images that closely match real-world data, making it ideal for training AI models and validating autonomous scanning algorithms. The workflow supports multiple AI policies (PI0, GR00T N1) and can be deployed using NVIDIA Holoscan for clinical applications, providing a complete pipeline from simulation to real-world deployment.

### 🐍 Conda Environment Setup

The robotic ultrasound workflow requires conda-based environment management due to mixed pip and system package dependencies.

Installation reference: [Miniconda Installation Guide](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions)

#### 1️⃣ Repository Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows.git
cd i4h-workflows
```

#### 2️⃣ Environment Creation & Dependency Installation
```bash
conda create -n robotic_ultrasound python=3.11 -y
conda activate robotic_ultrasound
bash tools/env_setup_robot_us.sh
```

**⚠️ Expected Build Time**: The environment setup process takes 40-60 minutes. You may encounter intermediary warnings about macaroon bakery library dependencies - these are non-critical and can be ignored.

#### 3️⃣ Environment Variable Configuration
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts:$PYTHONPATH
export RTI_LICENSE_FILE=<path-to-your-rti-license-file>
```

   <details>
   <summary>💾 Persistent Environment Configuration</summary>

   ```bash
   echo "export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts:\$PYTHONPATH" >> ~/.bashrc
   echo "export RTI_LICENSE_FILE=<path-to-your-rti-license-file>" >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   This ensures the environment variables are automatically set when you open new terminals.

   **Note:** If you have `robotic_surgery` workflow scripts or previous versions of `robotic_ultrasound` workflow scripts in your `PYTHONPATH`, you can reset it to include only the robotic_ultrasound scripts by running `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts`
   </details>

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ⚠️ Common Integration Issues

#### 🔧 Dependency Resolution Conflicts
```bash
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages...
isaaclab 0.34.9 requires torch==2.5.1, but you have torch 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
```
**Resolution**: These PyTorch version conflicts are expected and non-blocking. The workflow maintains compatibility across version differences.

#### 🔗 Module Import Resolution
**Symptoms**: `ModuleNotFoundError` or `Error while finding module specification for 'xxx'` during script execution
**Resolution**: Verify `PYTHONPATH` includes both `scripts/` directory and repository root.

#### 🔧 PI0 model fails to load
**Symptoms**: When using the PI0 policy for the scanning task, the model fails to load, or Isaac Sim appears stuck on the loading screen.
**Resolution**: Verify that your machine can reach Google APIs (`googleapis.com`). Although the model is hosted on Hugging Face, additional files are fetched from Google during initialization.
