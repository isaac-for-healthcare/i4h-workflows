## ü©∫ Technical Overview

The Robotic Surgery Workflow is a comprehensive solution designed for healthcare professionals and researchers working in the field of robotic-assisted surgery. This workflow provides a robust framework for simulating, training, and analyzing robotic surgical procedures in a virtual environment. It leverages NVIDIA's ray tracing capabilities to create highly realistic surgical simulations, enabling surgeons to practice complex procedures, researchers to develop new surgical techniques, and medical institutions to enhance their training programs. By offering a safe, controlled environment for surgical practice and research, this workflow helps improve surgical outcomes, reduce training costs, and advance the field of robotic surgery.

The framework supports multiple surgical robots and tasks:

- **dVRK (da Vinci Research Kit)**: Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) for minimally invasive surgery.
- **STAR (Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot)**: Autonomous surgical robot for tissue manipulation.
- **Multi-arm coordination**: Dual-arm surgical robot synchronization.
- **Surgical task simulation**: Needle lifting, suturing, peg transfer, and etc.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### ‚è±Ô∏è Installation Timeline
**Estimated Setup Duration:** 40-60 minutes (network-dependent asset downloads)

### üîç System Prerequisites Validation

#### GPU Architecture Requirements
- **NVIDIA GPU**: RT Core-enabled architecture (Ampere or later)
- **Compute Capability**: ‚â•8.6
- **VRAM**: ‚â•24GB GDDR6/HBM
- **Unsupported**: A100, H100 (lack RT Cores for ray tracing acceleration)

   <details>
   <summary>üîç GPU Compatibility Verification</summary>

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,compute_cap --format=csv,noheader
   ```

   Verify output shows compute capability ‚â•8.6 (Ampere/Ada Lovelace/Hopper with RT Cores)
   </details>

#### Driver & System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS / 24.04 LTS (x86_64)
- **NVIDIA Driver**: ‚â•535.129.03 (RTX ray tracing API support)
- **Memory Requirements**: ‚â•8GB GPU memory, ‚â•32GB system RAM

   <details>
   <summary>üîç Driver Version Validation</summary>

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader,nounits
   ```
   </details>

#### Software Dependencies
- **Python**: 3.10 (exact version required)

### üêç Conda Environment Setup

The robotic surgery workflow can be installed in a conda-based environment for dependency isolation and compatibility.

**Prerequisites**: Ensure [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) is installed on your system.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Creation
```bash
# Create isolated conda environment
conda create -n robotic_surgery python=3.10 -y
conda activate robotic_surgery
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Clone & Dependency Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows.git
cd i4h-workflows

# Install all dependencies (this takes 40-60 minutes)
bash tools/env_setup_robot_surgery.sh
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Build Time**: The environment setup process takes 40-60 minutes. You may encounter intermediary warnings about conflicting library dependencies - these are non-critical and can be ignored.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variable Configuration
```bash
# Set PYTHONPATH for current session
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts
```

   <details>
   <summary>üíæ Persistent Environment Configuration (Recommended)</summary>

   To avoid setting PYTHONPATH for every new terminal session:

   ```bash
   # Add to your shell profile
   echo "export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts:\$PYTHONPATH" >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   This ensures the environment variables are automatically set when you open new terminals.

   **Note:** If you have `robotic_surgery` workflow scripts or previous versions of `robotic_ultrasound` workflow scripts in your `PYTHONPATH`, you can reset it to include only the robotic_ultrasound scripts by running `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts`
   </details>


‚úÖ **Installation Complete** - Your robotic surgery simulation environment is ready.

## ‚ö° Running Workflows

### üéØ Quick Start Examples

#### ü§ñ Basic Robot Control - dVRK PSM Reach
```bash
conda activate robotic_surgery
python workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts/simulation/scripts/environments/state_machine/reach_psm_sm.py
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Isaac Sim launches with dVRK PSM simulation
- PSM arm moves to predefined target poses

> **‚è≥ First Run Loading Time**: Initial simulation loading takes 5-10 minutes for asset download and scene initialization. Isaac Sim may appear frozen with no console progress indication - this is normal behavior.

#### üî¨ Surgical Task Simulation - Needle Lifting
```bash
conda activate robotic_surgery
python workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts/simulation/scripts/environments/state_machine/lift_needle_sm.py
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Isaac Sim launches with robotic surgery simulation
- Surgical simulation with needle manipulation
- Precise grasping and lifting operations

#### üß† Reinforcement Learning Training
```bash
conda activate robotic_surgery
# Training (45+ minutes)
python workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts/simulation/scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/train.py --task Isaac-Reach-PSM-v0 --headless

# Evaluation/Play mode
python workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts/simulation/scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/play.py --task Isaac-Reach-PSM-Play-v0
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- RSL-RL agent training with GPU acceleration
- TensorBoard logging for training progress monitoring
- Trained model evaluation in simulation environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

#### üêå Long Loading Times
**Symptoms**: Isaac Sim appears frozen during initial loading
**Resolution**: This is expected behavior. Initial loading takes 5-10 minutes with no progress indication. Be patient and avoid force-closing the application.

#### üîó Module Import Errors
**Symptoms**: `ModuleNotFoundError` when running scripts
**Resolution**: Ensure `PYTHONPATH` includes the scripts directory:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts
```

#### üîß Environment Build Issues
**Symptoms**: Conflicting library dependency warnings during setup
**Resolution**: These warnings are non-critical and can be ignored. The environment will function correctly.
