### System Architecture

The telesurgery workflow presented here can be conceptually summarized by the following diagram.

![Telesurgery Diagram](./docs/images/overview.jpg)

- <b>Surgeon Side</b>: Includes the controller and display connected to the workstation.
- <b>Patient Side</b>: Includes the surgical robot and camera. In real-world workflows, both are physical devices. In simulation, they are virtual.

The surgeon uses the controller to operate the robot remotely. The robot’s actions and environment are captured by a camera and streamed back via DDS to the surgeon’s display in real-time.

### Controllers

Two types of controllers are supported:

- A Microsoft Xbox or compatible controller
- A Haply Inverse3 device for advanced, intuitive control of the robot (not yet fully supported in simulation)

> [!Note]
> In simulation mode, use the Xbox controller. Haply Inverse3 support is still under development.

### Robots

This workflow supports the [MIRA robot](https://virtualincision.com/mira/) from Virtual Incision in simulation and in the physical world.

### Cameras

#### Simulation
For the simulation workflow, there is a virtual camera that is located on the MIRA robot between the left and right arms.

![Camera](./docs/images/camera.jpg)


#### Real World
In the real world workflow, two camera types are currently supported

- Intel RealSense camera (can stream depth instead if supported by camera)
- cv2-compatible camera such as USB webcams

Future support: NVIDIA Holoscan Sensor Bridge (HSB) for low-latency video streaming.

### Displays

Any display can be used, but for minimal latency, a G-Sync enabled monitor with high refresh rate (e.g., 240Hz) is recommended.

### Machines

The surgeon and patient workstations can be x86_64 Ubuntu systems or IGX devkits. While they may run on the same machine, they are typically separate systems and can be located far apart.

> [!Note]
> Isaac Sim does not support arm64. The patient system must be x86_64 when running simulation workflows.

### Communication

Below describes the communication systems used between the surgeon and patient machines.

- <b>Control</b>: WebSockets transmit commands from surgeon to robot
- <b>Video</b>: DDS streams camera output from patient to surgeon

Prior to running, configure the `SURGEON_IP` and `PATIENT_IP` as shown [here](#2-environment-configuration).
The video is encoded (default: NVIDIA Video Codec), and parameters like bitrate and codec are [configurable](#advanced-nvidia-video-codec-configuration).

## ⚡ Running Workflows

### Real World Environment

The real world workflow requires a MIRA robot from Virtual Incision.  Once the MIRA robot is up and running, there is an API
daemon service that will listen in the background for commands sent from the surgeon controller application.  The robot is not
necessary if you only want to test the video streaming functionality.

For the camera(s) on the patient side, you can plug a Realsense camera or a USB webcam to the patient's workstation
and place it in the desired location.  The MIRA robot also comes with a camera, and you can interface with it by using an HDMI capture
card, or HDMI to USB-C capture card.

#### 1️⃣ Build Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows.git
cd i4h-workflows
workflows/telesurgery/docker/real.sh build
```

#### 2️⃣ Running Applications

##### Patient Application
```bash
# Start the Docker Container
workflows/telesurgery/docker/real.sh run

# Getting video from the camera
python patient/physical/camera.py --camera [realsense|cv2] --name robot --width 1280 --height 720
```

##### Surgeon Application

There are two applications to start on the surgeon side
- <b>Viewer</b>: `surgeon/viewer.py` starts the application to receive video stream from the robot's camera
- <b>Controller</b>: `surgeon/gamepad.py` or `surgeon/haply.py` starts the application to allow the surgeon to control the robot

Each application is started independently, and allows multiple surgeons/users to connect to the robot's camera
while one surgeon may have control of the robot.

Run the following to receive video stream from the robot camera:
```bash
# Start the Docker Container
workflows/telesurgery/docker/real.sh run

# Start the Surgeon Viewer Application
python surgeon/viewer.py --name robot --width 1280 --height 720 2> /dev/null
```

Run the following to control the robot using a game controller:
```bash
# Start the Docker Container
workflows/telesurgery/docker/real.sh run

# Run the Gamepad Controller Application
python surgeon/gamepad.py --api_host ${PATIENT_IP} --api_port 8081
```

Or run the following to control the robot using Haply Inverse3:
```bash
# Start the Docker Container
workflows/telesurgery/docker/real.sh run

# Run the Gamepad Controller Application
python surgeon/haply.py --api_host ${PATIENT_IP} --api_port 8081
```

### Simulation Environment

The simulation workflow runs Isaac Sim on the patient side to simulate and control the robot in a physics-based environment, enabling development, testing, and validation of robot behaviors in realistic scenarios.  In the scene, there is a MIRA robot with a camera located between its left and right arms (see [image](#simulation)).  The video that is streamed over to the surgeon application comes from this camera i.e., the surgeon will only see what is visible from this camera's perspective.

> [!Note]
> Allow the patient application to fully initialize before starting the surgeon’s viewer to avoid delays, otherwise the viewer application may appear to hang while waiting for a video stream.

#### 1️⃣ Build Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows.git
cd i4h-workflows
workflows/telesurgery/docker/sim.sh build
```

#### 2️⃣ Running Applications

##### Patient Application
```bash
# Start the Docker Container
workflows/telesurgery/docker/sim.sh run

# Start the Patient Application
python patient/simulation/main.py
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- The initial view displayed in Isaac Sim is a suture needle on top of a white, reflective surface.
- To understand the elements in the scene (e.g. the MIRA robot), you can customize the viewport `Camera` to `Perspective` or `Top` view.

![Telesurgery Viewport](../../docs/source/telesurgery_viewport.gif)

> [!Note]
> While Isaac Sim is loading, you may see the message "Isaac Sim is not responding". It can take approximately several minutes to download the assets and models from the internet and load them to the scene. If this is the first time you run the workflow, it can take up to 10 minutes.

##### Surgeon Application

There are two applications to start on the surgeon side
- <b>Viewer</b>: `surgeon/viewer.py` starts the application to receive video stream from the robot's camera
- <b>Controller</b>: `surgeon/gamepad.py` starts the application to allow the surgeon to control the robot

Each application is started independently, and allows multiple surgeons/users to connect to the robot's camera
while one surgeon may have control of the robot.

Run the following to receive video stream from the robot camera:
```bash
# Start the Docker Container
workflows/telesurgery/docker/sim.sh run

# Start the Surgeon Viewer Application
python surgeon/viewer.py --name robot --width 1280 --height 720 2> /dev/null
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- The surgeon sees only what is visible from the camera located on the MIRA robot and does not have access to other views
- In the initial scene, a suture needle on a white, reflective surface will be visible from the robot camera as shown below

![Surgeon View](./docs/images/surgeon_video.jpg)

Run the following to control the robot:
```bash
# Start the Docker Container
workflows/telesurgery/docker/sim.sh run

# Run the Gamepad Controller Application
python surgeon/gamepad.py --api_host ${PATIENT_IP} --api_port 8081
```

See [keybindings](./docs/gamepad.md) for how to use the game controller.

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### NTP Server Setup
An NTP (Network Time Protocol) server provides accurate time information to clients over a computer network. NTP is designed to synchronize the clocks of computers to a reference time source, ensuring all devices on the network maintain the same time.

```bash
# Run your own NTP server in the background
docker run -d --name ntp-server --restart=always -p 123:123/udp cturra/ntp

# Check if it's running
docker logs ntp-server

# fix server ip in env.sh for NTP Server
export NTP_SERVER_HOST=<NTP server address>

# To stop the server
docker stop ntp-server && docker rm ntp-server
```

### Advanced NVIDIA Video Codec Configuration

The applications streams H.264 by default using NVIDIA Video Codec. Additional encoding parameters can be customized in the Patient application using the `--encoder_params` argument:

```bash
python patient/simulation/main.py --encoder nvc --encoder_params patient/nvc_encoder_params.json
```

#### Sample Encoding Parameters

Here's an example of encoding parameters in JSON format:

```json
{
    "codec": "H264", // Possible values: H264 or HEVC
    "preset": "P3", // Options include P3, P4, P5, P6, P7
    "bitrate": 10000000,
    "frame_rate": 60,
    "rate_control_mode": 1, // Options: 0 for Constant QP, 1 for Variable bitrate, 2 for Constant bitrate
    "multi_pass_encoding": 0 // Options: 0 to disable, 1 for Quarter resolution, 2 for Full resolution
}
```

### Advanced NVJPEG Configuration

Adjust the quality of encoded frames using the NVJPEG encoder by editing the [nvjpeg_encoder_params.json](./scripts/patient/nvjpeg_encoder_params.json) file. Simply change the quality parameter to a value between 1 and 100:

```json
{
    "quality": 90
}
```
