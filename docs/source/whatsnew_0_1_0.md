The Robotic Ultrasound Workflow provides a comprehensive instruction for simulating and developing robotic ultrasound workflow. Key features include:

*   **Policy Evaluation & Runner:** Includes examples for running pre-trained policies within the simulation.
*   **State Machine Examples:** Demonstrates structured task execution, like a liver scan state machine with data collection capabilities.
*   **Teleoperation:** Allows direct control of the robotic arm using keyboard, SpaceMouse, or gamepad for precise manipulation of the ultrasound probe.
*   **Ultrasound Raytracing:** Implements a standalone ultrasound raytracing simulator that generates realistic ultrasound images based on 3D meshes.
*   **DDS Communication:** Utilizes RTI Connext DDS for inter-process communication between simulation, policy runners, and visualization tools.

The Robotic Surgery Workflow provides tools and examples for simulating surgical robot tasks, focusing on training and evaluating robotic policies. Based initially on the [ORBIT-Surgical](https://orbit-surgical.github.io/) framework, it includes:

*   **State Machine Implementations:** Examples of state-based control for surgical procedures.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Provides a framework for training RL policies for surgical subtasks.

## Tutorials

Get started with customizing the simulation environment:

*   [Bring Your Own Patient](../../tutorials/assets/bring_your_own_patient/README.md): Learn how to import and integrate custom CT or MRI scans into USD (Universal Scene Description) files for simulation.
*   [Bring Your Own Robot](../../tutorials/assets/bring_your_own_robot/README.md): Guidance on importing custom robot models (CAD/URDF) and replacing components, such as swapping a gripper for an ultrasound probe.
*   [Sim2Real Transition](../../tutorials/sim2real/README.md): Outlines steps for adapting policies trained in simulation for deployment on the physical world system using DDS for data transfer.
